trivial and can sometimes be lots of fun.</p><p>I had this album&rsquo;s title written down in a list of possible song names that I
keep in my notebook. I wasn&rsquo;t really thinking about it until I started seeing
the album cover showing up online after I pushed the <em>publish</em> button.</p><p>And then it hit me:</p><p>Â«The Last Time I Had Fun (It Was A Long Time Ago)Â»</p><p>When was the last time I had fun? What does it mean to have fun? What the hell
is fun?</p><p>I make no secret of my life long struggle with depression, anxiety, panic
attacks and agoraphobia. I used to be shy about it and keep it to myself as people
see it as a weakness. It isn&rsquo;t. Of course it is not.</p><p>When I had my first panic attack I was just in my twenties and it scared me
shitless. I had no idea what was happening to me. I was living in a relatively
small town and I had maybe heard the word <em>depression</em> a few times, always
referring to someone no one would dare go near to.</p><p><img src=https://mirkocaserta.com/images/posts/societal-myth-sarah-andersen.png alt="Societal Myth">
<a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CjiZuPOsOr4/>credits</a></p><p>These days things are a bit better. Mental illness still carries around a
stigma but more and more people are aware of what it means to be depressed, to
experience debilitating anxiety and so on.</p><p>I am still scared shitless of my condition but I&rsquo;ve somewhat learned to live
with it. I spend most of my days working at home so I don&rsquo;t get easily
triggered, except for family or job matters. It&rsquo;s manageable though.</p><p>But yeah, I can&rsquo;t remember when it was the last time I&rsquo;ve had fun. I&rsquo;ve had
some. The most fun I have these days is playing music for myself at home. So,
in a sense, this is me trying to share some of my fun, knowing that not
everyone has fun the same way and most won&rsquo;t like my music, but some will, and
it is for those that I do this.</p><iframe src=https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1FAPWs1rEGJ4FZpwHAzgM5 width=100% height=380 frameborder=0 allowtransparency=true allow=encrypted-media></iframe></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg><span class=tag><a href=https://mirkocaserta.com/tags/music/>music</a></span></p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-folder meta-icon"><path d="M22 19a2 2 0 01-2 2H4a2 2 0 01-2-2V5a2 2 0 012-2h5l2 3h9a2 2 0 012 2z"/></svg><span class=tag><a href=https://mirkocaserta.com/categories/music/>music</a></span></p></div></main></div><footer class=footer></footer></div><script type=text/javascript src=https://mirkocaserta.com/bundle.min.bb2c6bc3ed452ca4759660e4020811f248bc2320081559e8a32d8b0092773852941133639d35e8370d03d3ddaa750b1edd6b343c5bd22a55d5bdeae8f648f49b.js integrity="sha512-uyxrw+1FLKR1lmDkAggR8ki8IyAIFVnooy2LAJJ3OFKUETNjnTXoNw0D092qdQse3Ws0PFvSKlXVvero9kj0mw=="></script></body></html>
