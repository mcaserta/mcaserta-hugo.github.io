Actually, I played the
organ first, as my dad had a transistor one that was pretty state of the art for
the time (I was born in 1974 so you get the idea).</p><p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve been playing keyboards since forever and I&rsquo;ve also picked up
different instruments over the years, probably too many of them as I never
really mastered one.</p><p>But black and white keys is what my brain sees when I hear music. I tend to
think in piano terms first.</p><p>Some people tell me they wish to hear me play the piano more as they don&rsquo;t
really enjoy me playing bass or guitar or synths or whatever it is that I&rsquo;m
obsessed with at the moment.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not a good piano player. I&rsquo;m not even an average piano player. My technique
is lacking in so many ways I can&rsquo;t even begin to count them. However, I can
maybe hold my own with ballads as they allow me the freedom and the time to
think and move things around.</p><p>I believe there are many places in this album where you can clearly hear me
thinking &ldquo;well, where do I go now?&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s fine with me. I&rsquo;m not a professional
musician and I don&rsquo;t need everything to be perfect. In fact, there are several
places where you can hear me making errors, failing to reach a note or playing
something that&rsquo;s not really <em>kosher</em>.</p><p>You know what? I don&rsquo;t care. You get to hear what I played with no edits. I want
this to be sincere. It might be flawed&mldr; well, it definitely is flawed in many
ways, but at least it&rsquo;s me you are hearing.</p><p>The songs in this album are tunes that have kept me company for years. Except
maybe for <em>Lotus Blossom</em>, which I discovered quite recently while watching
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_Dreams>Field</a>
<a href=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097351/>Of</a>
<a href=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/field_of_dreams>Dreams</a>. I have been
listening to Jazz all my life and I had to discover this Billy Strayhorn
masterpiece through Kevin Costner, can you believe that?</p><p>Anyway, I hope you like my very contrieved shoestring playing.</p><p>You can listen to Ballads for free by clicking
