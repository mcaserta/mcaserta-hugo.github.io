Actually, I played the
organ first, as my dad had a transistor one that was pretty state of the art
for the time (I was born in 1974 so you get the idea).</p><p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve been playing keyboards since forever and I&rsquo;ve also picked up
different instruments over the years, probably too many of them as I never
really mastered one.</p><p>But black and white keys is what my brain sees when I hear music. I tend to
think in piano terms first.</p><p>Some people tell me they wish to hear me play the piano more as they don&rsquo;t
really enjoy me playing bass or guitar or synths or whatever it is that I&rsquo;m
obsessed with at the moment.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not a good piano player. I&rsquo;m not even an average piano player. My technique
is lacking in so many ways I can&rsquo;t even begin to count them. However, I can
maybe hold my own with ballads as they allow me the freedom and the time to
think and move things around.</p><p>I believe there are many places in this album where you can clearly hear me
thinking &ldquo;well, where do I go now?&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s fine with me. I&rsquo;m not a
professional musician and I don&rsquo;t need everything to be perfect. In fact, there
are several places where you can hear me making errors, failing to reach a note
or playing something that&rsquo;s not really <em>kosher</em>.</p><p>You know what? I don&rsquo;t care. You get to hear what I played with no edits. I
want this to be sincere. It might be flawed&mldr; well, it definitely is flawed in
many ways, but at least it&rsquo;s me you are hearing.</p><p>The songs in this album are tunes that have kept me company for years. Except
maybe for <em>Lotus Blossom</em>, which I discovered quite recently while watching
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_Dreams>Field</a>
<a href=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097351/>Of</a>
<a href=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/field_of_dreams>Dreams</a>. I have been
listening to Jazz all my life and I had to discover this Billy Strayhorn
masterpiece through Kevin Costner, can you believe that?</p><p>Anyway, I hope you like my very contrieved shoestring playing.</p><iframe src=https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/71mnsBvWrEEk9XiBNfERRT width=100% height=380 frameborder=0 allowtransparency=true allow=encrypted-media></iframe></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg><span class=tag><a href=https://mirkocaserta.com/tags/music/>music</a></span></p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-folder meta-icon"><path d="M22 19a2 2 0 01-2 2H4a2 2 0 01-2-2V5a2 2 0 012-2h5l2 3h9a2 2 0 012 2z"/></svg><span class=tag><a href=https://mirkocaserta.com/categories/music/>music</a></span></p></div></main></div><footer class=footer></footer></div><script type=text/javascript src=https://mirkocaserta.com/bundle.min.bb2c6bc3ed452ca4759660e4020811f248bc2320081559e8a32d8b0092773852941133639d35e8370d03d3ddaa750b1edd6b343c5bd22a55d5bdeae8f648f49b.js integrity="sha512-uyxrw+1FLKR1lmDkAggR8ki8IyAIFVnooy2LAJJ3OFKUETNjnTXoNw0D092qdQse3Ws0PFvSKlXVvero9kj0mw=="></script></body></html>
