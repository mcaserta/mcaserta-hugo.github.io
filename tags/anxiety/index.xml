      <description>As a software developer, you will always find yourself in times when someone is putting an abysmal amount of pressure on you to complete something.&#xA;This is normal and not something under your control. Accept this is how every job works and take it for granted as the oxygen in the air you breathe.&#xA;Can this be avoided? If you have an enlightened project manager/team leader/whatever, she won&amp;rsquo;t put any pressure on you.</description>
