It takes a while to load but what you are seeing above is a live emulation of the screensaver software.
Once it&amp;rsquo;s loaded, the following commands are available through the keyboard:
key use A amber mode B binary mode D dna mode F full charset mode (default) G green mode (default) H hex mode L lgbtq mode Q quit You can take a look at the source code in my C64 Playground repository on github and download the prg image for your retro emulation enjoyment.</description></item><item><title>ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ The Matrix Screensaver for Commodore 64</title><link>/posts/2021/05/the-matrix-screensaver-for-commodore-64/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 May 2021 12:19:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2021/05/the-matrix-screensaver-for-commodore-64/</guid><description>I am trying to learn some 6502 assembly and this is the result of one of my first experiments.
