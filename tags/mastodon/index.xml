      <description>Since the latest twitter issues due to Space Karen, I got myself a Mastodon account and I must say that, so far, the experience has been extremely positive, possibly due to the fact that most of the people I follow are well behaved nerds who care about sharing good vibes. If you also feel like joining, please take a look at Join Mastodon and see for yourself.&#xA;Anyway, I found myself pretty soon in the need to automate my posts.</description>
